## <a name='top'></a>Documentation for online world music, popular music, and music appreciation courses.

These materials provide a guide to teaching the large online non-major courses at FSU that were created by Christopher Witulski between 2014 and 2016. Please send any questions to [cwitulski@fsu.edu](mailto:cwitulski@fsu.edu). These documents are designed to be easy to edit and update using Markdown syntax converted to HTML with [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org). See [Editing this Documentation](#edit-docs), below.

## <a name='about'></a>About these Courses

This suite of courses includes classes focused on world music, popular music, and Western music history. They exist simultaneously at a number of levels so that different offerings are available depending on department need. As of summer 2016, we have been focused on IFS2072 *A Social History of American Popular Music*, IFS2073 *Music in the World*, and MUL2010 *Music Literature, Listening, and Understanding*. These choices are largely based on recent changes to the FSU liberal studies program, but as that adaps and evolves, other levels of each set of content may become necessary. The same content can be used in approved versions of MUH2019 *Modern Popular Music*, MUH2051 *Music in World Cultures*, and MUH2512 *Music in World Cultures-Majors*. These have been approved by the Faculty Senate and can run with minimal adaptation to the current online structures. The main changes would require adjustments as appropriate to the projects: as those courses are not approved for E-Learning designations, there is more flexibility for the instructor to change or remove collaborative multi-stage projects.

This documentation focuses on the procedures for directing these courses. Specific concerns regarding each individual course [follow](#courses). To view and begin setting up the courses for a given semester, use the Blackboard course copy tool. See [Teaching the Online Courses](#teaching).

### <a name='e-series'></a>Liberal Studies and E-Series (as of now) at FSU

As tempting as it may be to describe the E-Series program at Florida State, it is currently in flux. As of now, the focus of the program is in creating and offering courses that develop "interdisciplinary and flexible thinkers." As such, the courses labeled IFS are required to:

* engage students in broad, critical, and creative thinking about contemporary problems,
* include substantive writing that includes feedback, revisions, and reevaluation,
* require a range of assessments from essays to hands-on team projects, and
* include weekly opportunities for discussion and interaction.

The most up-to-date descriptions of this and other requirements are at the [FSU Liberal Studies](http://liberalstudies.fsu.edu) page.

Notably, these IFS courses are currently approved through the Faculty Senate as they currently exist. At their start, they were the only online courses that achieved this designation and the intensive, multi-stage collaborative projects were one reason that they were granted E-Series status. If (when) the E-Series program adapts, they will need to be revisited to meet any new requirements. At the time of their approval, there were substantial financial incentives to creating these classes. If those cease, it may not be worth the effort for students during the semester to complete the collaborative projects from distance and, therefore, these classes may be better situated in their original forms (as non-E-Series general education courses for major and non-major students). The E-Series designation currently fuels a great deal of interest and enrollment, but that may not always be the case.

Similarly, because of this designation, *any changes to the projects that make up IFS2072 or IFS2073 need to be made with careful attention to current E-Series requirements.*

Each class also satisfies the following other liberal studies designations:

* IFS2072: E-Series, Cultural Practice, Diversity: Western Experience
* IFS2073: E-Series, Cultural Practice, Diversity: Cross Cultural Studies, Scholarship in Practice
* MUH2010: Cultural Practice (also part of the state core curriculum)
* MUH2019: Cultural Practice, Diversity: Western Experience
* MUH2051, MUH2512: Cultural Practice, Diversity: Cross Cultural Studies

## <a name='documents'></a>Course Documents

Course documents in PDF and DOCX format for these classes are downloadable using the following links. The schedules are from the last time that each course ran, but they will provide a clear and easily updatable template for future semesters.

Each syllabus includes required FSU language, but also contains language specific to online courses concerning participation, expectations for online interactions, explanation of policies regarding issues common to online courses (such as problems with technology and missed deadlines), and the required information regarding each liberal studies designation. These can obviously be heavily adapted, though some elements like the liberal studies materials must stay as is.

Other documents for each course, including project directions and rubrics, are under [Specific Information on Each Course](#courses).

### <a name='general'></a>Best Practices for Online Teaching

"Best" practices are quite fluid and depend on the goals of a class or assignment. There are a few trends that these classes follow that are worth articulating directly.

#### All course documents and project descriptions are in both DOCX and PDF format.

One potential useful change would be the creation of HTML versions for easier access by students. It is worth keeping PDFs available as they are easily downloaded and printed (while preserving formatting to avoid one mode of potential confusion). DOCX files allow for screen readers and other adaptive access-related technologies. I provide DOCX and PDF for all course materials for these reasons, though additional HTML may streamline some elements of teaching and taking the classes. That said, they also introduce a third variation that would require an update whenever changes are made.

#### Details must be consistent throughout the course materials.

Any confusion will be found by students and may result in 150 email questions coming your way the next morning. For this reason, most details are in one and only one place within the course content. Students are directed to the schedule (PDF and DOCX) for information on deadlines, for example. None are hard-coded into the content of the online interface nor do they appear in project descriptions. Similarly, assignment directions are only in one downloadable document, also a PDF and DOCX. They are not posted online except for in a few rare instances because of the submission method.

#### Announcements are frequent and detailed.

Student engagement depends on instructor engagement, which is most frequently through announcements. I have found frequent, single-subject announcements to work better than large lists of minor ones. This may be irritating for some students as their inboxes fill, but it makes it easier to (1) not miss an announcement buried at the end of an email and (2) delete or store announcements when they are not (or not any longer) relevant. A call-to-action, if necessary, should be clear and early in the announcement.

#### Announcements should be emailed.

There is a choice to send an email directly from the announcement page. This is far more dependable than hoping that students are studiously checking the online course materials each morning for updates. It meets them where they are: always a necessary consideration for these types of courses.

#### Interactions with students always go through the instructor of record.

This is a personal preference for me (Christopher Witulski), but it has worked well. It is advice that does not need to be followed. Other than grading, I believe that all interactions with students should come through me directly, shielding my TAs from any potential issues. Most student questions are not content related in a course of this type and I would prefer to have had the entirety of the interaction with students when it comes to making difficult decisions about missed deadlines, technology-based exemptions or extensions, or grade-related questions.

### <a name='before'></a>Preparing for the Semester

These are general steps to be taken before the beginning of a given semester.

1. **Create the course** using the online tool through Blackboard. As of this writing, it can be found through the main [Blackboard page](http://campus.fsu.edu) by clicking `Request a Course/Dev Site` in the upper left-hand corner. From there, select "Request a Course Site." Here, you can choose an individual or cohort page. Cohorts work well for courses split among different sections. For example, IFS courses often include independent sections for main campus students, Panama City students, and honors students. Cohorts make these multi-section courses far easier to maintain. Choose your sections (the list populates from registrar information), and click "Next." If your section is not appearing, you may need to speak to the College of Music. This process can take a few days, so do it early as there is not much to do until it is complete.

2. **Update the course syllabus** heading information, any textbook changes (such as edition), and the course schedule for the current semester's dates.

3. **Read through these materials** and share the TA handbook with your readers.

4. **Copy the course into the new location** once Blackboard is up and running. You can use the aptly named "course copy tool."

5. **Replace old course documents** (syllabus and schedule) with the update versions.

6. **Add your teaching assistants** by selecting the `Users and Groups` tool near the bottom of the left hand menu from within the new course. Select `Users` and use the `Find Users to Enroll` button to search by Blackboard username. This is usually the same as the first half of the teaching assistant's email address, but if not, you may just need to ask the TA over email.

7. **Click through all pages of the course, checking for dead links**, both for embedded video content and external web sites. You may need to contact the Office of Distance Learning to work out technical issues with embedded videos. They are constantly updating their video library collection interface, which is good, but during some semester breaks, that causes trouble with importing media content into new course sites. Replace any missing videos or fix any dead links, including any descriptive text related to the now changed content. Things change on the internet and, even more frequently, things change in how Blackboard's inner workings deal with different content. Media will break or links will stop working throughout the semester, but you will be better off having found as many of those problems beforehand as is possible. Otherwise: hundreds of emails at once.

8. **Assign quizzes by updating the due dates.** In most of these courses, the assessments are grouped together, making this task easier.

9. **Clear out any old materials** like announcements, discussion posts, or other remaining content from the assignments portions of the course site.

### <a name='first-day'></a>First Day of the Semester

FSU's first day attendance policies are not well-suited for online courses. There is a tool in Blackboard, but I have been warned that it does not work as expected. Overcoming this issue while also ensuring that all of your students are properly set up is tricky. Here is one method that I have used successfully, though you can try a different way if you prefer.

The goals here are to:

1. Notify students that the course exists, reminding them to check in and get started,

2. Keep track of incoming students who add the course after the semester begins, and

3. Compile a list of students who are not responsive, the best equivalence of missing the first class period that we have in an online setting.

This list gets reported and non-responsive students are automatically dropped from the course. "Playing it safe" and keeping everyone may have consequences for students' financial aid when the semester ends.

#### One procedure for dealing with "first day" issues

1. On the first day of the semester, save the course roster. Exporting from the Grade Book is the easiest way to do this. Save the downloaded file as spreadsheet that you can edit in something like Excel. (Much of running these courses involves dealing with CSV or TSV documents and Excel.)

2. Ensure that there is at least one assignment due by your first day reporting deadline. This information will come through email multiple times before the beginning of the semester.

3. Announce the course to students and direct them to the Blackboard website (currently http://campus.fsu.edu). Have Blackboard send it as an email since few students think of their online courses during the first week. Specifically direct them to complete the "first day" assignment. It can be a basic course introduction quiz. I include one that is based on the syllabus and is full of true/false questions that they can retake until they are all true. (Things like "I own, have access to, or have ordered the textbook.") This is a good time to remind them that they need to provide documentation if they require accommodations in the course.

4. In a day or two, send another announcement, also over email, welcoming recent additions and reminding all students of the first day assignment and accommodations. Reiterate that failure to complete the first day assignment (which is easy!) will get them dropped from the course.

5. Repeat every other day until the deadline with more red bold and dire phrasing each time. Students who add near the end of the add/drop period may not look back through old announcements and may, therefore, not realize these issues. For this reason, I consider adding the course late as an act of attendance. But those students may still need an email reminder to go into the course and get started.

6. When the deadline arrives, compare the current roster with the one that you saved from the first day. If a student WAS on the first day roster and IS STILL in the course, plus that student DID NOT complete the assignment, add him or her to an absentee list. Follow directions from the many First Day Attendance reminder emails that have been flooding your inbox to submit the list.

7. Invariably, one or two students will ask to be let back in. Sometimes the main office can accommodate these requests for late (re-)adds. They should contact the office themselves.

8. Remind the remaining students (both new and old) that they still have other upcoming deadlines so that the online course does not get lost in early-semester confusion for each of them.
