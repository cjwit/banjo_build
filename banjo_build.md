# <a name='top'></a>Building a (fretless, tackhead, block rim) banjo

## <a name='top'></a>Introduction

I prepared this document specifically for two students who are interested in building banjos. If you found your way here, feel free to reach out at [chris.witulski@gmail.com](mailto:chris.witulski@gmail.com) or [my homepage](https://cjwit.github.io) with any questions, comments, or (more likely) suggestions. I've built a handful of these and I'm happy with how they came out. I hope that this can be helpful!

For what it's worth, here are some photos from two recent builds. The first is cherry and ipe and the second is Ambrosia maple and purpleheart. Click for larger images.

## <a name='tools'></a>Tools and Materials

I had a few goals in building an instrument when I first did it in 2018.

1. This should be cheaper than buying one.
2. Since people have been building banjos for longer than power tools have been around, I should be able to do it without buying a bunch of stuff.

With that in mind, here is a rough list of necessary tools and materials. I'll give some other useful alternatives below, in case you have access to them.

When I did this the first time, I didn't have much in the way of tools. Just a drill and some similarly basic things. Being cheap, I went to Harbor Frieght and bought a handful of things that looked useful. Harbor Frieght being what it is, they were hardly useful, but they got the job done. It's been a pleasure replacing those things one by one. This is to say, you can get by with super cheap tools on softer wood. They don't make the work any easier and certainly don't make it any more pleasurable.

I've since learned more about hand tools ([this is a good read](https://lostartpress.com/products/the-anarchists-tool-chest)) and have been replacing things one by one with older tools. These are still pretty cheap and I'm pretty sure I would have started this way had I known about it as an option. [This guy](https://www.hyperkitten.com/HKTC_new/index.php) has some really great stuff and it's worth keeping an eye on his listings. The other advice: don't bother with sets of things. Spend the same amount and get the one that you need, but of a higher quality. Most of these are things that I've since used in everyday life. They're good to have around.

> **Joe and Zachary:** I'll be able to lend you a belt sander, files, rasps, coping saw, peg reamer, and sharpening stone. You can use my radial arm saw for the block rim segments and a hand saw for the string slots. We may try using my router for the rim pieces, if that's the best way to go. This means that you'll need clamps and a drill. I can give you some wax and steel wool. You'll go through enough of the other things that you'll want your own. I also don't have much finish left, otherwise I'd let you borrow it. I can also give you some fishing line.

### Useful power tools

* **Mitre saw, chop saw, or radial arm saw:** This will help you when you're cutting blocks for the rim and for smaller tasks elsewhere.
* **Band saw, circular saw, or panel saw:** You need something to make the big cuts. Access to a band saw is best.
* **Drill:** for starting your peg holes
* **Router:** This can be useful for a fretboard scoop, but there are other ways to do that, too. I did the scoop on the cherry banjo above with a router (it's flat) and cut out the deep scoop on the other one by hand.
* **Power sander:** I rigged up an old belt sander to work as a bench sander. It made a huge difference and was pretty easy to do. You just need to attach some scrap pieces to a larger board so you can clamp it down. Then I shoved a wedge-shaped piece of scrap into the handle to hold in on. In the future, I'll get a foot pedal. An oscilating sander can help, too, but not until pretty far into the project.

### Hand tools

* **Clamps:** You need so many clamps to glue up the neck. Get a set of at least four bar clamps. The cheapest ones at the store will be fine. They need to be able to screw down tight, so not the "clip" kind, though those are helpful for other things if you have them.
* **Coping saw:** This will help in cutting the peghead and (hopefully) taking the waste out of the inside of the rim rings. I've used a spindle sander for this in the past, but those are not as easy to come by.
* **Hand saw or small files:** These will help in various spots, but especially when it's time to cut string slots in the bridge and nut.
* **Chisel**: Go for one that's at least one that is wide-ish. A half inch or so would probably be most useful. Having two is more useful. My 3/4 has come in handy, but now I have a 1/4 inch one that I thing will also be super useful on future builds, too.
* **Files and rasps:** These make a difference with shaping.
* **Peg reamer:** This is for tapering the holes so that the pegs fit. It's the only banjo-specific tool here and, I can say from experience, that [the one from Stew-Mac](https://www.stewmac.com/luthier-tools-and-supplies/types-of-tools/reamers/peghole-reamers.html) is worth the money when compared to cheap ones on Amazon.
* **Sharpening stone:** You can probably get through a job without this, but it's how you sharpen a chisel and hand plane in the future. There are lots of kinds. They all work. Eventually, if you continue with hand tools, you would want a fine and course grit stone (you can get one with two sides), a leather "strop," and some polishing compound.

### Not sure if these are tools or materials

* **Eye, ear, and respoatory protection:** Goggles and ear plugs (for power tools) are a must. So are dust masks (like N95s), especially with certain types of woods that can mess with your lungs.
* **Sandpaper:** You'll be sanding forever. Get a box of quality paper in a range of grits up to 400 or so. I've bought the cheap stuff. It doesn't work well.
* **Painter's tape:** This is the blue stuff. You'll be using it to glue up the block rim. The 1 inch thick version is fine.
* **Wood glue:** Titebond is the standard. You'll probably want more than the small bottle. The one that looks like a restaurant katchup bottle is enough.
* **Finish:** I've used Tru-Oil, which is a gunstock finish. As advertised, it's easy and idiotproof. It's also tough, which is good for something that you handle (like a banjo or gun stock)
* **Paste wax:** Johnson's Floor Wax does the trick. It just smells terrible for a while.
* **Tack cloth:** This is to apply finish, but you can also use an old t-shirt. Just cut it up into squares.
* **Steel wool:** 0000, which is very fine, will help with the final few bouts of sanding and finishing.

### Materials

* **Wood:** Using two different kinds works well: one for the instrument itself and a second (very hard) wood for things like the fingerboard, peghead, tailpiece, and any contrasting decorations. I'll come back to this below.
* **Skin for the head:** [Elderly Instruments](https://www.elderly.com) sells calf and goat skin heads. Get one that's a good deal bigger than your planned hoop so that you have something to grab on to when glung and tacking. The thin goat skin has worked well for me. [Jeff Menzies](https://www.facebook.com/jeff.menzies.39) prepares and sells his own down in Jamaica. They're more (usually $50 or so), but they look great. I've heard that they work beautifully, too, but I haven't tried them (yet).
* **Tacks:** Apolstry tacks work well. They should be pretty heavy duty, have broad heads, and look good. Brass looks nice on wood, but that's a taste thing.
* **Pegs:** Violin pegs work well. I've just ordered cheap sets from Amazon. Be sure that they are tapered and not "blanks," though. And remember that you need five, so two sets.
**Strings:** [Aquila Nylgut nylon strings](https://aquilacorde.com/en/shop/modern-instrument-string-sets/timeless-banjo-minstrel-banjo-en/nylgut-banjo-and-minstrel-banjo/) work well for this kind of instrument. I've used the red series, the regular nylon, and the minstrel set. The reds have a texture to them that feels really nice, but it's preference. Using the minstrel set will put your banjo about a fourth below standard tuning.
* **Scrap wood:** You'll need some for the bridge (pine works, or something left over), tailpiece, and heel cap (if you want one).
* **Fishing line:** There are a few ways to connect a tail piece to the dowel. Thick (heavy guage) fishing line is one of them.

### Some optional details

* **Wood or synthetic veneers:** These give that pinstripe look between different types of wood. [LMII sells them.](https://www.lmii.com/148-veneers) Putting them around a "stripe" of the wood you use for a fretboard gives strength and some good detail. You can see it in the photo below.
* **Stain:** Some people like the look of a stained head. Check out [Romero Banjos](http://www.romerobanjos.com) for some beautiful examples. I used a gel stain from General Finishes when doing this. You can also stain the wood, but that's less common.
* **Brass position markers:** You can see these in the photo of the back of the neck on the cherry banjo here. They are just holes drilled into the neck at various fret locations and filled with small pieces of a brass rod. [OnlineMetals.com](https://www.onlinemetals.com/) sells, well, metals online. They have a warehouse in nearby Toledo (among others) where you can pick up an order. They also ship.
* **Flush frets and frets:** Installing frets involves some extra steps and tools. There are plenty of videos on how to do it, but the main thing is that you need to keep an eye on when you complete each step so that you can ensure paraellel lines and even frets. This build is fretless.

## Buying wood

When I was starting with my first build, choosing wood was one of the most mysterious parts. Finish was (and continues to be) another. There are three big questions:

1. What kind of wood do I choose?
2. How much do I need?
3. Where do I get it?

A third one is relevant if you don't have a table saw or band saw in your garage, like me:

4. How do I cut this wood?

Northwest Ohio has a great local place called Laborie Farms in Portage, just outside of Bowling Green. That's the place to go. They also cut wood to size, though it can take a while if they're working with someone to design a kitchen instead of sell $100 worth of scrap for a banjo. So, that's easy. They have local types and a pile of "exotics" that can range from cheap to rediculously expensive. It's fun to poke around. So that's questions 3 and 4.

### Choosing wood

Best advice here: look at photos from makers. Pick something that you think is attractive and that you've heard of before, at least for the main wood. I loved working with cherry. The ambrosia maple was really interesting: it's maple (super common), but with these stains from insects that lived (past tense) in the tree. Figured and curly maple are gorgeous, but more expensive. I've seen walnut, which is softer (and local to here in Wood County).

Fingerboards need to be hard and smooth. Some of the good choices here can be really expensive, but you're also not looking for much, so it might be worth it. Common ones are ebony (obviously, but not really available and problematic), pau ferro, cocobolo, and figured maple. Others are cheaper, like hard maple, ipe, and rosewood. I've used hard maple (which is boring), ipe (super dark), and purpleheart (which eventually turns dark brown).

There are some cool native options, too. Persimmon and osange orange seem to be popping up more often, for example.

Since the main issue is hardness, it's good to reference a [Janka hardness chart](https://www.bellforestproducts.com/info/janka-hardness/). The higher the number, the harder the wood. It also gets more difficult to work with. You'll see the fingerboard woods in the 2500-3000 range, but hard maple (1450) works just fine for nylon strings, too.

Trim woods can be anything. I like getting extra pieces of the fingerboard wood and using that for consistency, but you can do whatever. Potential spots for trim would be:

* A line down the neck
* The base of the rim
* A heel cap (back of the neck where it flattens and meets the rim)
* The peghead top

I've never done inlays, but I hear that they are not impossible. They just require some extra tools, patience, and creativity. Trim wood could serve as an inlay, or the more common shell (or plastic).

End of the day: choose something that you can find and like. It's nice to look at the piece you're buying, so I've never ordered and shipped anything.

### Wood amounts (a cut list)

You can never have too much scrap, so take these as bare minimums from someone who is cheap and has lucked out by not making enough mistakes to get stuck.

There are two main parts of a banjo to build: the rim and the neck. There are tons of ways to do each, but I've done each two ways. I'll quickly mention one and then go into detail on the other for each part.

#### For the block rim

I've steam bent a rim and done block rims. Steam bending was a pain, but worked. The blocks were more intricate to assemble, but less stressful in one single moment of bending. We're doing a block rim here.

Steam bending involves building a steam box out of PVC, watching it melt, then doing it out of wood, watching it disintigrate, and hoping that you have enough heat to work. You also have to build a form and figure out a contraption to give you leverage. And you need a steamer. It's hard to get a perfect circle, but since you're gluing a head, that's not really much of an issue. Either way, it works, but it's a pain. (I also did it with a quarter inch thick piece of ash instead of the more common laminations, but that's another story. It was old school.)

For the block rim, you get long pieces of wood, cut trapazoids, and assemble an octogan. After a bunch of prep work, you stack them and glue them together to get the proper depth.

To get the size, you need to draw out a circle and work out the geometry. I found a thumbnail image once a while back that gives an idea, though. It's hard to read and the main site isn't there anymore. (If anyone in the internet has info, I'd love to link directly to the creator!)

<img src="images/block-rim-pattern.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Patterns for block rim shapes">

Taking the larger size rim for the sake of overestimating the amount of wood, you need 8 segments that are each 5 3/16 inches on the outside. Since you flip the wood, it's really 4 times (5 3/16" + *math and stuff*). I'd guess high and call it 5 1/4" times 8 segments for 42" per lamination (per hoop that you'll glue together). If your wood is 1" thick and you want a 3" deep rim, you need three laminations. By the time you cut and sand, it might be short, so guess high. That's four laminations for 168" or 14 feet. The pattern gives a width of 1 11/16". A 2x4 prepped is usually 1 3/4" thick, not 2". So take the 1 11/16" and call it 2".

Some people also use a harder wood for the top of the rim to serve as a wooden tone ring. If you pick something soft, you may want consider that.

That means: 14 feet of wood that's 2 inches wide and 1 inch thick. If you want a cap, you can make that last lamination out of something different, so 3.5 feet of trim an 10.5 feet of the main wood. Always get more.

#### For the neck

I've used two techniques for building a neck. You can see each in the photos at the top of the page. The purpleheart/maple banjo stacks pieces of wood horizontally together. For the cherry/ipe one, I cut a 4x4 in half, folded it on itself (vertically) and put a piece of ipe in between. This second approach gives extra strength because the two long pieces of cherry reinforce each other. Plus, the ipe serves as a super hard bracing (like a truss rod).

I like the second way (the cherry/ipe one), but the first way is far easier. We'll start there. I got the idea from another website (among many) that outlines a banjo building process and also describes all sorts of good woodworking methods, not to mention how to get into and out of problems. [I recommend reading this completely!](https://www.thekimerers.net/brian/minstrel2/) 

[This page in particular](https://www.thekimerers.net/brian/minstrel2/neckpieces.shtml) has the layout that we'll use. It comes out to 68" of 1" by 4". Let's call that 6 feet. 7 to be safe. The 4" might really be 3 1/2" after all is said and done.

So, the neck and dowel stick are 7 feet of 1" x 4".

#### For the fingerboard

The fingerboard material is a little different. It should be thinner (1/4" thick works) and it should be about 3 1/2 to 4" wide like the neck wood. It's basically going to lay over the top of the entire next and peghead. If you want a different material for the peghead, go for it. If you want to use figured maple for the neck and skip the fingerboard entirely, go for it. 

In any case, you'll want about 24" to allow for extra on the fretboard, plus 7 or 8 inches to allow for extra on the peghead. You'll also want some scrap for other odds and ends (like the tail piece). This is a gross overestimate: math-wise, if you include a scoop, you can probably get away with 24 inches total. Maybe less. Let's call it 3 feet.

So, the fingerboard material is 2 to 3 feet of 1/4" x 4". It's hard to get 1/4 inch thick stock, so you might buy a 1" thick piece and split it in half on a bandsaw.

#### Totals and board feet

You buy wood in board feet (BF), which is calculated as one inch thick 12x12 pieces. You can look up estimates of prices online, but it varies. I'd check my math if I were you.

Part | Long | Wide | Thick | BF
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- 
Rim | 14' | 2" | 1" | 28
Neck | 7' | 4" | 1" | 28
Fingerboard | 2-3' | 4" | 1" | 8-12

## Building the rim

A block rim is basically a stacked set of "laminations." Each of these is an octagon (though you also see 12 or 16 segments). You can mismatch pieces to get a checkerboard pattern or use different woods for different laminations for stripes, rim caps, wooden tone rings, etc. There are a bunch of videos and examples around the internet, this is a distillation that I've used.

### Cutting blocks

Splitting a circle into segments involves some math for angles. Look back at that layout example above, that's where these numbers below come from. You're dividing 180° by the number of segments. I found it useful to draw up a plan: this is for a 16-segment rim that I hope to do sometime soon. There's a smaller one in there for a banjo ukelele that I want to make for my kiddos. It's hard to read, since I drew this out on brown paper, but it might be worth the time to sketch out what you're looking for, especially if you are not doing an 11- or 12-inch rim. The measurements for those are below.

<a href="images/rim_plan.jpg">
    <img src="images/rim_plan_sm.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Rim plan drawing">
</a>

Segments | Angles | Long side (11") | Long side (12")
--- | --- | --- | ---
8 | 22.5° | 4 3/4" | 5 3/16"
12 | 15° | 3 1/16" | 3 3/8"
16 | 11.25° | 2 9/32" | 2 1/2"

These are the angles for your trapezoids. The lengths are really specific. When all is said and done, it's most important that **the angles are right** and that **the segments are all the same size**. If they are a little bigger or smaller, it just means that your hoop will be a little bigger or smaller. That doesn't matter at all.

The easiest way to cut them is using a chop saw, mitre saw, or radial arm saw. Basically, a tool that makes repeated identical cuts easy. Do this once with a test piece of long scrap, if you have it.

First, set the angle and make one cut to get the end off. Then, you can use the angled side of that end piece as a block so that each other piece is identical in length. Do this by flipping it and clamping it to the saw itself. The piece I cut for this photo was a little short, so I clamped another scrap as a stopper.

<a href="images/sawing_rim_segments.jpg">
    <img src="images/sawing_rim_segments_sm.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Sawing rim segments">
</a>

From here, you just flip the stock (the long wood you are cutting) to align with your block, slide it down, and make the next cut. Take it off, flip the stock, slide it down, cut. 

When you get half of your segments for one of the laminations, lay them out on the floor. They should make a half circle. You can check by lining up a straight edge (a ruler or the long piece of wood that you're cutting). If it's way off, you'll want to adjust the angles and redo them. You can cut these a bit shorter (shave off the angle) and make a smaller rim if necessary. Since you're hopefully working with scrap, that's not a problem. A small half circle will give you the same angles as a large one.

Once you're set, get your regular stock (or put it back on) and keep cutting. If you are doing 3 laminations of 8 segments, you'll need 24 of these segments. Lay out and check your octogons as you go. (This photo shows them glued and taped, which comes next, but you get the idea.)

<a href="images/layout_segments.jpg">
    <img src="images/layout_segments_sm.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Laying out rim segments">
</a>

If they are off by a little, you can shave off the difference in a few ways. One that I remember from the many YouTube videos I watched involved a table saw, where you basically lay out the two half circles and cut their ends flat so that they mate well. Drawing a line with a straight edge and cutting with a hand saw should work, too. Be careful of sanding since you can end up with rounded edges. This would mess with your gluing surface.
